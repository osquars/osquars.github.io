                    <h3 id="weapontraits">Weapon Traits</h3>
                    <p>With weapons that are <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 204, 0);">common</span> or higher rarity, you will have traits that you can unlock on <a href="http://forums.fatsharkgames.com/discussion/844/red-moon-inn-lobby-explaining">the Forge</a> (Red Moon Inn thread).</p>
                    <p>This traits will give a buff of some sort. It can be everything from replenish ammo to more stamina and more.</p>
                    <p class="uk-text-success uk-text-bold">What traits works for what weapons?</p>
                    <p>So this is what I have right now and I hope I got it right.</p>
                    <ul class="uk-list">
                        <li><i class="uk-icon-certificate"></i> <strong>Universal</strong> (All weapons ish)</li>
                        <li><i class="uk-icon-certificate"></i> <strong>General</strong> (Similar weapons)</li>
                        <li><i class="uk-icon-certificate"></i> <strong>Unique</strong> (Specific weapon)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The traits can be a Universal version that almost all weapons can use (can be exceptions). Or a General version that are for similar weapons. Last we have some Unique traits for certain weapons.</p>
                    <p class="uk-text-success uk-text-bold">Is their a level on the traits?</p>
                    <p>No, but we have proc chance when we upgrade the weapons and unlock the trait. Randomized between two values of the stats.</p>
                    <ul class="uk-list">
                        <li><i class="uk-icon-certificate"></i> Before unlocking the trait, the description might say like this: <em>When blocking an enemy with this weapon, there is a <strong>2-10% chance</strong> that the block wont cost any stamina.</em></li>
                        <li><i class="uk-icon-certificate"></i> After you have unlocked it might say: <em>When blocking an enemy with this weapon, there is a <strong>4% chance</strong> that the block wont cost any stamina.</em></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="trinkettraits">Trinket Traits</h3>
                    <p>Traits on trinkets are a little different from traits on weapons. First off you do not need to unlock them. Second you can use same trinkets for all your characters at the "same time". Third this traits will buff the character instead of the weapons like healing bonus or chance to get a new buff postion when use the potion.</p>

                    <h3 id="herotrinkets">Hero Trinkets</h3>
                    <p>With the first free DLC (Sigmarâ€™s Blessing) we got Hero Trinkets. Trinkets that boost the chances to get loot for that character in the Loot roll. One Trinket for each Character and it is also used on the Shrine when praying for an Item.</p>
