                    <h3 id="attackstyles">Attack styles</h3>
                    <h4 class="uk-text-success">Attack</h4>
                    <p>All weapons have their way of hitting the enemies. Some can hit more than one enemy and some can easily damage heavier enemies like Stormvermin. While some will have problems with heavier enemies.</p>
                    <p>For melee there is everything from slashing, bashing, piercing, swinging and Stabbing. For ranged we have more of how hard it can hit, dispersion and range. Where magic have everything from missiles to Area of effect.</p>
                    <p>All melee weapons have a series of attack motions for both Normal and Charged attacks (varies from weapon to weapon). Max is 3. You can combine this attacks to get the full use of them.</p>
                    <p>Normal attacks is a tap with left mouse button. Charged attacks is holding down the left mouse button. But you might just need to hold it in for 0.5-1 sec. and not wait for the animation to be fully done.</p>
                    <p class="uk-text-success">Example - Dwarf Ranger:</p>
                    <ul class="uk-list">
                        <li><i class="uk-icon-certificate"></i> <span class="uk-text-success">Normal attacks</span> - 1. Slice from right, 2. Slice from left, 3. Hack from top.</li>
                        <li><i class="uk-icon-certificate"></i> <span class="uk-text-success">Charged attack</span> - 1. Bash forward, 2. Swing from left, 3. Swing from right.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I might want to attack with Charged (1) first to get the skaven pushed back a little and get one with a Normal (2) hit and finish with a charged (3) to separate them one more time and even get a kill on it. This can give me hits on the skavens without them hitting me. Less damage on me and i can fight more before i need to heal and survive the mission.</p>
                    <p>Or it can be a horde attacking and you see the first skavens are coming one by one. You can then do the combo with Normal 1, Normal 2 and after that more than one skaven are just in front of you and you can finish it with C3 to push them off before you do a next combo or just attack with normal.</p>
                    <h4 class="uk-text-success">Block</h4>
                    <p>Block and push can help you and your friends survive longer and to make more attacks. By splitting up the skavens makes it harder for them to hit you and you can attack easier an enemy that is by them self without get hit yourself.</p>
                    <h4 class="uk-text-success">Overcharge</h4>
                    <p>When the Bright Wizard uses her magic she starts to fill her overcharged meter. when she get over 30%ish (notches in the meter) she will take longer to cooldown and you can start ventilate by using your reload button. It will ventilate only down to this notches. After that it will cooldown in normal speed. Bright wizard will cooldown as soon as she do not use the staff and when using the melee weapon.</p>
                    <p>See my separate thread for <a href="http://forums.fatsharkgames.com/discussion/855/weapon-stats-explaining">weapon stats</a> where i try to give you the strength, weakness and attack styles for every weapons.</p>
                    <p>Remember that this is not officially from the Fatshark. I have only made this to start understand how things work in the game and to start discussions about it.</p>
