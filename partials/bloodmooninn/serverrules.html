                    <h2>Guidelines:</h2>
                    <p><strong>Always Be Civil:</strong><br>Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, rude or abusive.<br>Respect each other. Just treat everyone with respect, and you shall receive so back.<br>Disagreements and directed comments are allowed but remember to criticize ideas, not people. Personal attacks won't be tolerated. Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.</p>
                    <p><strong>If You See a Problem, Report It</strong><br>When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just report it for a moderator to look into and take action if necessary.</p>
